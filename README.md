# calculate-reading-time
A quick PHP function for calculating reading time of a piece of content.  Returns the reading time for a string of text, based on the assumption that the average person reads at 200 WPM, and rounds the fractional seconds to the nearest whole minute.

# yes, I know...
In reality, the average is closer to 238 WPM, but have you seen humanity lately?  I'm not willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.
